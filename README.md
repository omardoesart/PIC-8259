Project Description
The project aims to design and implement a Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) based on the 8259-architecture using Verilog hardware description language. The 8259 PIC is a crucial component in computer systems responsible for managing and prioritizing interrupt requests, facilitating efficient communication between peripherals and the CPU.
